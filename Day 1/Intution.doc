Easy version :- Given an array of size “N”; and a number “D”; please tell me how many subarrays in the array have “D” occurring for “M” times; 

-> [2 5 2 5 2 5 1 1] D = 5 M = 2;

-> Brute Force :- Generate all subarrays and check how many subarrays are valid; 

-> https://www.jdoodle.com/ia/1AVU 

-> TC - O(N^2.) 
-> Takes O(1) size space;

Optimization :-> prefix array 

-> p[]
-> p[i] = how many times “D” is coming in b from range [1…i] 

-> p[] is pre-calculated;


-> we travel at each index j; and try to count how many valid subarrays end at index “j”; 

-> do this for each index j; and total is the answer 
-> p[j] tells us how many times “d” is coming from 1 to j; 
-> so any index i if it exists such that p[i] == p[j] - m; then [i+1….j] is valid subarray because “d” is coming “m” times in the [i+1…j]; 

-> p[i] == p[j] - m ; 
-> p[j] - p[i] == m; 
-> frequency of d(1…..j) - frequency of d(      1……i) = m;

-> Logic - https://www.jdoodle.com/ia/1AW5 

-> When you are at index j; you know p[j]; p[i]==p[j]-m;
-> z == p[j]-m; so if you know how many times “z” is coming in range [0…….j-1] your problem is solved; 

-> hashmap G
<prefix,frequency>

TC - O(N)
Takes O(N.) size space; 

Final space optimization:-> Remove the prefix; array -> can be solved using only hashmap space no need of prefix array space; 


Hardest Version :- Given an array of size “N”; find the number of valid subarrays; 

-> subarray is valid if :- [i………………..j] -> count1/count2 = m/n; 

-> count1 = frequency of “d” in [i….j] 
-> count2 = frequency of “z” in [i….j]

-> d,z are given;  

-> Brute Force; -> Generate all subarrays and check if valid do count = count + 1

-> Valid condition :-  f(d)*n == m*f(z); 

 TC - O(N^2) 

Optimization :- 

-> p1[i] = how many times “d” is coming from index 1 to i 
-> p2[i] = how many times “z” is coming from index 1 to i 

-> f(d) = p1[j] - p1[i-1] 
-> f(z) = p2[j] - p2[i-1] 


-> n*p1[j] - n*p1[i-1] = m*p2[j] - m*p2[i-1] 
-> m*p2[i-1] - n*p1[i-1]  = m*p2[j] - n*p1[j] 

-> [i……j] is valid; 


-> Count all valid subarrays ending at index j; 
-> For given z; calculate RHS = m*p2[j] - n*p1[j];
-> now in range [0…..j-1] you want to know how many “i” have their equation value as m*p2[i-1] - n*p1[i-1] == RHS; 

-> [i…….j] -> if both d and z are coming 0 time in this subarray then also our algorithm will count it -> Subtract the count of subarrays where both d and z are coming 0 times from the final answer
